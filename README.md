I am a 3rd(?) year microbiology PhD student in the Lennon lab. I really love studying viruses and how they can manipulate host processes. I have a black belt in two disciplines of Korean martial arts!

Course expectations:
1. getting used to git!
2. learning more data wrangling techniques
3. Getting more familiar with different statistical analyses
